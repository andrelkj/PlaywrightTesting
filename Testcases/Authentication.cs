     * Once authenticated, it is possible to store the state in the browser context so you can bypass any further login attempts
     *
     * Steps required:
     * 1. Create a new browsers context providing the http credentials with the login credentials
     * 2. Store this authenticated context in a variable
     * 3. Build pages from the authenticated browsers context whenever you want these credentials to be applied
     *
     * Note: the initial browser context can still be used for building pages, but it won't contain the authenticate state
